      <p class="px-4 py-2">My story as a full-stack developer is one driven by a lifelong fascination with the digital world. From countless hours spent immersed in video games as a child, to the endless exploration of online sites, I've always been captivated by the 'how' behind the technology that shapes our lives. This inherent curiosity ultimately led me to a pivotal decision on my very first day of university. Originally enrolled in an electrical and electronic engineering program, I realized my true passion lay in the creation of software, the building of those very digital worlds that had so intrigued me.</p>
      <p class="px-4 py-2">This redirection led me to the foundational principles of programming in 2021 with the C language. This experience provided a crucial understanding of core programming logic. In 2022, I delved into C++ and My SQL, a turning point where I discovered not just an ability, but a genuine passion for coding. The concepts of object-oriented programming resonated deeply, solidifying my desire to pursue software development. However, like many students, academic demands led to a temporary shift in focus following my second-year examinations.</p>
      <p class="px-4 py-2">In 2023, as I joined my third year, the desire to create returned with renewed vigor. I began the practical journey of web development, transitioning from theoretical exercises to tangible results. The simple act of writing 'Hello World' in an HTML 
        'p' tag, first in my notebook, and then in VS Code, was a revelation. Progressing through CSS and JavaScript was challenging, especially after the abstract nature of coding on paper. However, each hurdle overcome fueled my determination to master the art of web development.</p>
      <p class="px-4 py-2">Upon completing my final university examinations in 2024, I faced the critical task of defining my specialization. Researching the vast landscape of software development, I discovered the distinct roles of front-end and back-end development. Leveraging my existing knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I chose Vue.js for the front-end, drawn to its progressive nature and elegant structure. For the back-end, Laravel (PHP) was a natural fit, given its prevalence and my exposure to PHP through my classmates' projects.</p>
      <p class="px-4 py-2">Currently, I am channeling my skills and passion into 'Spire Rentals,' a property management platform. This project represents the culmination of my learning journey, a practical application of the skills I've acquired. Building this platform has presented challenges, but each obstacle is viewed as an opportunity for growth and refinement. My dedication to continuous learning remains unwavering, and I am excited to contribute my skills to innovative and impactful projects.</p>
      <p class="px-4 py-2">I am a developer who is driven by curiosity, fueled by passion, and committed to continuous improvement.</p>
